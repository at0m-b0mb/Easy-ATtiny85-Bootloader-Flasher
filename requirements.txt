# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# Fedora/RHEL:   sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
# macOS:         tkinter comes with Python from python.org
# Windows:       tkinter comes with official Python installers

# No additional pip packages are required for the GUI.
# All dependencies are part of Python's standard library.
